This repository hosts two projects that dive into the realm of biometric identification using signature and fingerprint analysis. By leveraging image processing techniques and pattern recognition, these projects aim to establish secure and accurate identification systems.

## Projects Overview

### Signature Forge Detection

This project is designed to detect signature forgeries using structural similarity indexes and image processing methods. It demonstrates the ability to differentiate between genuine and forged signatures effectively.

#### Steps Involved:

1. Import Dataset
2. Perform Canny Edge Detection
3. Apply Morphological Operations for image enhancement
4. Compute Structural Similarity Index of genuine and Forged Signatures

### Fingerprint Identification System

The goal of this notebook is to develop a fingerprint identification system. The system processes the fingerprint images, enhancing and extracting unique features such as minutiae to match fingerprints with high precision.

#### Steps Involved:

1. Fingerprint segmentation
2. Estimation of local ridge orientation
3. Estimation of local ridge frequency
4. Fingerprint enhancement
5. Detection of minutiae positions
6. Estimation of minutiae directions
7. Creation of local structures
8. Fingerprint comparison
9. Apply the entire process on a new dataset
10. Create a pipeline
